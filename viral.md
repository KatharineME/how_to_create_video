## General

The idea for the video matters way more than the editing or aesthetics.

Giving 2x the effort when making the video will probably result in 10x the views.

Its easier to make one video that gets 5 million views than it is to make 50 videos that each get 100,000 views.

## Hook

Transient attention lasts 8 seconds. You must hook them in this time. Focus them on the goal of the video and show them it is what they were expecting.

Focused attention lasts 4 minutes. Add something particularly exciting or interesting every 4 minutes to hold them.

## Story

Always interesting, no boring or slow parts.

No extra fat, only the interesting bits delivered well.

Make people excited for what is coming next in the video. Make sure they have to stick around to hear about it.

Assure viewers immediately you will return on those expectations.

Add cuts and B ans C cams with other angles to keep the video more interesting.

Have a good payoff at the end.

You want to make a video you cant find anywhere else.

You want them to get so excited so they have to watch another.

Have a side story that is introduced in the beginning and concluded only at the end so that if people click away, they are left wondering how the side story concludes.

Reveal the payoff at the end

Include people reacting honestly

Use large text pop ups to emphasize important details and keep things interesting.
